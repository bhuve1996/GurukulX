# Config Layer

- All runtime configuration (env, feature flags, adapter choice) is read and exported from `lib/config`. App and data layer import config from here; avoid `process.env` elsewhere.
- Validate required config at startup or first access and fail fast with clear errors.
- Use typed config objects so changing a key or default is a single edit.
